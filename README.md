# vqa_vizwiz
machine learning model to answer any question posed on any given image using only the features in the image

Dataset used 
Vizwiz dataset containing around 20k for training and 4k for validation and 8k for testing. Each question/ image has approximately 10 answers. We used around 1000 for training and validation and 100 for testing, due to lack of computation resources.

For image processing Vgg16 model was used to extract the image features.
